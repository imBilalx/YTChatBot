ref_summary = """Mosquito bites are more dangerous to humans than any other animal bite due to their ability to transmit 
diseases like West Nile, Zika, malaria, and dengue. It's only the female mosquitoes that bite us, they use our blood 
to grow their eggs. Scientists have discovered that the mosquito’s mouth, called a proboscis, isn't just one tiny 
spear but a system of thin needles, each of which pierces the skin, finds blood vessels and makes it easy for 
mosquitoes to suck blood out.

Mosquitoes also have more than 150 receptors on their antennae and proboscis that help them find victims or figure 
out if the water is nutritious enough to lay eggs in. The mosquitoes track the carbon dioxide we exhale and as they 
get closer, they detect body heat and substances called volatile fatty acids from our skin. The volatile fatty acids 
given off by our skin reflect differences between men and women and even what we’ve eaten, making some people more 
attractive to mosquitoes than others.

Once a mosquito’s proboscis pierces the skin, one of its six needles, called the labrum, uses receptors on its tip to 
find a blood vessel. The chemicals in our blood guide the labrum to our blood vessels. The discovery of these 
receptors could help in the development of new mosquito repellents.

When a mosquito pierces the skin, a sheath called the labium stays outside as six needle-like parts known as stylets 
are pushed in. Two of these needles, called maxillae, saw through the skin. Another set of needles, the mandibles, 
hold tissues apart while the mosquito works. As a mosquito’s gut fills up with blood, she separates the water from 
the red blood cells and squeezes it out.

The sixth needle, the hypopharynx, serves a dual purpose as it drips saliva into us which contains chemicals that 
keep our blood flowing and also makes our blood vessels dilate, blocks our immune response and lubricates the 
proboscis. Mosquito saliva also serves as a conduit for dangerous viruses and parasites.

Mosquito-borne diseases are a significant health problem globally. Malaria alone sickened over 300 million people and 
killed around 635,000 in 2015, mostly children under the age of five and pregnant women in sub-Saharan Africa. Dengue 
fever is estimated to make almost 400 million people sick each year with severe joint pain. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes 
are believed to be the main culprit for more than 350 confirmed cases of congenital malformations associated with the 
Zika virus in Brazil.

To reduce the chances of contracting a mosquito-borne disease, public health experts recommend wearing mosquito 
repellent, checking the screens on doors and windows, and eliminating standing water inside and around our homes."""

eval_summary_1 = "Mosquitoes are the deadliest animals in the world, killing hundreds of thousands of people each year, particularly children and pregnant women. Only female mosquitoes bite humans to obtain blood for their eggs. They have sophisticated tools for biting, including a protective sheath, six needles, and receptors to guide them to blood vessels. They use one needle like a straw to consume blood, while another releases chemicals to make blood flow easily and cause itchy welts. They may also leave behind viruses or parasites in their saliva, which can sicken or kill humans. The video emphasizes the importance of preventing mosquito breeding by eliminating standing water where their larvae develop. The narrator encourages viewers to subscribe for more science videos. The main themes are the sophisticated biology of mosquito bites and the importance of mosquito control to prevent disease. The video uses a mix of scientific description and casual language to engage and educate viewers."
