ref_summary = """"Building a capsule wardrobe involves reducing your clothing items to a bare minimum, focusing on comfort, quality, and interchangeability. The first step is to decide your aesthetic. 

A versatile, minimalistic wardrobe example includes: Pleated trousers (black & beige), Jeans (blue & cream), Striped oxford shirts (off-white and blue), Crewnecks (grey & beige), a grey hoodie, overcoats (taupe and black), adidas samba sneakers, black leather loafers, and black leather Chelsea boots. 

If your style leans towards streetwear, modify some aspects like opting for puffer jackets instead of overcoats, cargo pants instead of pleated trousers, and rugged combat boots instead of loafers and Chelsea boots. 

Accessories can greatly influence your style; consider investing in bracelets, rings, necklaces, watches, hats, bags, and belts. High-quality pieces need not be expensive. Brands like Uniqlo offer good quality at reasonable prices. 

Other recommended brands include ASKET, Aur√©lien, Luca Faloni, Oliver Cabell, Velasca, CDLP, CLAE EU, Form&Thread, ISTO., CLOSED, Collars & Co., Hamilton & Hare, JAK, Somewhere Sunny, Waldor & Co., and Wax London.
