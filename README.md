# YouTube Summarization Chatbot

This project encompasses a chatbot, powered by [OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/) model, and hosted on a [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) application. This chatbot is designed to generate summaries for YouTube videos provided by the user via a textual link.

Once you've received the quick summary, you also have the option to ask follow-up questions about the video. Moreover, you can ask the chatbot to summarize another video anytime.

The chatbot interfaces with the YouTube Transcript API to retrieve video transcripts which it then summarizes, presenting a transcription that distills the key points and main content of the video.
