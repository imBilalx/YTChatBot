text4 = "Lose Yourself by Eminem is a motivational anthem that encourages listeners to seize their opportunities and follow their passions, regardless of the difficulties and risks involved. The song uses the metaphor of a rap battle to represent life’s challenges and choices, as the protagonist has to face his fears and doubts and deliver his best performance in front of a hostile crowd. The song also emphasises the importance of self-confidence, perseverance, and authenticity, as the protagonist has to rely on his own skills and voice to express himself and impress others. The chorus of the song sums up the main message: “You better lose yourself in the music, the moment / You own it, you better never let it go / You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow / This opportunity comes once in a lifetime“."

text3 = "It's basically a logbook that contains every transaction ever made. Every 10 or so minutes the new transactions are updated into the logbook by miners (called a new block). They then need to find a specific code that fits with this logbook. If they find it they 'validate' this page containing the last 10 min worth of trades in the logbook, and get the reward in BTC for finding and solving this block. This block is then added to the already existing chain of blocks containing all transactions ever made."

text2 = "The text explores the high costs of fearing loneliness, underscoring that it can lead to unhappy relationships, stunt personal growth, and result in widespread unhappiness. The fear of being alone often leads to poor choice of companions, lack of assertiveness in relationships, learned helplessness, and lost opportunities for potential relationships. It also hinders individuals from exploring their feelings, developing their identities, and expanding their curiosity. The author emphasizes that solitude should not be viewed negatively, but as a chance for patience, self-discovery, and creating truly satisfying connections."

text = """"It’s not hard to understand the fear of being alone: the empty apartment after work, the eerieness of 
Sunday afternoons, the sense of exclusion during the holidays… We know the agonies of being on our own very well. 
What is far less well understood, and less eloquently or frequently described, is the enormously high price exacted 
on the other side of the equation. The fear, or more often simply the phobia, of being alone is perhaps responsible 
for more unhappy relationships, more throttling of psychological development, more claustrophobia and more pent up 
misery than almost any other: it is – by any reckoning – one of the single greatest contributors to human misery and 
the driver of some of our weightiest and most unfortunate decisions. If only we were able to get the costs of what is 
for the most part a simple misapprehension clear in our minds, we might save ourselves a substantial portion of our 
lives.

We can pick out at least seven unnecessary penalties: – For a start, and most obviously, people who are afraid of 
being alone make some very wrong choices around the company they keep. They have no option but to privilege any one 
over the appropriate one. They have no stomach to be rightfully demanding in their criteria of entry, to insist that 
someone should be interesting rather than just cosy, challenging rather than just attractive, undefensive rather than 
merely confident. They don’t have the strength to be able to hold out – as one must – for the 20th or 200th 
candidate. The only souls with any realistic chance of ending up with the partner they deserve are those who have 
properly reconciled themselves to the prospect of never being with anyone at all. – Being with not quite the right 
person sounds almost bearable but extended over time, like a proverbial pebble in a shoe, ‘slightly wrong’ ends up 
indistinguishable from ‘entirely horrific’. No nagging doubt one has ever entertained on a wedding day will fail, 
with the addition of several years, to become a cause for mind-shattering despair. Every beautiful location we travel 
to together will be ruined, every promising moment will be trampled upon, every success will be compromised. What may 
begin as slight fractiousness or tedium winds up as cataclysmic irritation, self-disgust, sexual misery, 
broken finances and the kind of excruciating loneliness that – ironically – merely and innocently being ‘on our own’ 
would never have the power to generate. – Furthermore, when terrified of loneliness, we have no strength to argue for 
our needs within any relationship. One is always at the mercy of the one who fears loneliness less. Partners develop 
an advanced sense of the person who has nowhere else to go. It’s no use stamping our feet after an argument and 
saying ‘we’ve had enough’ when, in reality, everyone knows that we will never have had enough – so scared are we of 
having dinner on our own. – What’s worse, after time in the wrong sort of company, we tend to develop learned 
helplessness: every reluctance we once had to be alone grows worse, even as we acquire more experience of what bad 
company actually means. In our comfortable but deadening captivity, the wild appears more terrifying still: we can’t 
now imagine ever knowing how to change the dishwasher fluid alone, walking into a party by ourselves or taking the 
initiative to send our nephews birthday presents, so used have we become to using the other to compensate for our 
weaknesses. We experience none of the bracing, but also educative pressures visited upon the single, who have no 
choice but to overcome their inhibitions: those brave souls who, battling against their temperaments and histories, 
have to learn how to garden, deal with the council, go on holidays in the mountains, endure empty weekends, 
call up their mother or cook a chicken – and thereby achieve the resilient competence upon which true social 
discrimination and liberty rest. – For those who have too lightly signed away their freedoms, there are sure to be 
constant, and searing, reminders of what they have foregone. Every party and every walk down a busy street will 
provide evidence of what might have been, all those potentially fascinating or charming members of humanity they have 
now forever been disbarred from getting to know – because they were so unnaturally scared of having a bed to 
themselves for a few more years. – It isn’t just other people we won’t get to know, it’s also ourselves. The constant 
presence of companions stops us from making friends with our own minds, and exploring our feelings and ideas in a way 
that only extended stretches of solitude allow. We fail to develop our identities, we grow more like everyone else. 
The chatter outside prevents us from being able to follow the feint but vital dialogue we might otherwise have been 
able to have with ourselves. We use another person to distract us whenever any slightly painful or challenging 
internal matter comes into view. There ends up being so much we won’t ever really feel or understand about ourselves, 
so many big questions about our careers and our ultimate purpose that we will ignore, because there was always 
someone else on hand to chat to about what to order in for dinner. – Worst of all, we might not even be actively 
miserable after a while. We’ll grow used to cosy mediocrity. We won’t be curious or restless. We won’t dare – as the 
single must – to go up to strangers and risk our pride. We’ll stop learning. We’ll believe that we’ve answered our 
needs completely, but only on the basis of suppressing our knowledge of what our needs really are. We’ll have ended 
up in a conspiracy against uncertainty, novelty and the flux of life.

To start to correct everything that stems from this pernicious fear of being alone, we should from a young age learn 
that that being alone never means there is something wrong with us, just that we are being appropriately patient, 
until what truly satisfies us shows up (if it ever does); we have a choice; we have not been punished. Furthermore, 
being alone does not have to mean being cut off from humanity; the state may indeed be the surest way to commune 
deeply with it, to fill our minds with the ideas and visions of billions of other humans across time and space – 
whose perspectives are too often snuffed out when we’re under immediate pressure to respond to someone else in the 
room. We will never learn the true promise of community, discover our own interests or hold out for the connections 
we deserve until we make genuine peace with the prospect of a life by ourselves."""
